        "p2": "In March 2020, we started rescuing German shepherds and some small dogs with Erzsike Börcsök and Anna Nistonits Kriston (they are not founding members). ",
        "p3": "In 2020, we found loving homes for about 110 dogs. This year was one of my proudest ones in my life. Although it started as a hobby, it has become part of my life today. I consider it a mission for anyone who wants a dog to adopt from a rescue instead of buying one. ",
        "p4": "It makes me feel wonderful to save animals and we do it with our heart & soul. ",
        "p5": "I feel that a lot of people appreciate our work. This foundation was also created because many of you asked how we could be supported. We are very grateful for that. ",
        "p6": "We started out as civilians and for one year we covered all the costs ourselves. However, we want to be able to do more, start neutering, boarding more dogs, helping the dogs with their medical expenses, helping the temporary shelters with food, but that we cannot do on our own. ",
        "p7": "As we are unfortunately unable to use the SZJA 1% yet in Hungary (funding available to some organizations via donations through tax returns), we would be grateful if you could support the foundation. ",

        "p2": "If you love dogs but are unable to make a long-term commitment to adopt, why not consider perhaps fostering one of our dogs?",
        "p3": "Fostering is one of the most important and rewarding aspects of our organization for the dogs that we might be able to help. When you open your home to an animal in need, it means that you are saving the life of that dog either as he/she has been on the streets, in a very difficult situation, or had no chances at a place where he/she ended up.",
        "p4": "If we don’t act quickly in these situations finding homes for the dogs that might still have a chance with us, they might not have a chance otherwise. We could be their last hope since even though there might be other rescues elsewhere, they are also facing difficulties in many cases taking in more animals.",
        "p5": "By fostering one of our dogs means that you will host the animal entrusted to you at your home. While an animal is in your care, our organization will provide you with the food and medication of that dog. If they need any medical attention such as any treatment or given any medication (in tablet or liquid form), we would explain to you all the details related to how it would need to be done. We will also expect you to keep us informed of their health and get in touch with us right away if you notice any issues that need attention. If you also have animals of your own, it is important to make sure that they are up-to-date with their vaccines.",

        "p2": "The German Shepherd or German Shepherd Dog, is a German breed of working dog, originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. The breed also goes by the name Alsatian or Alsatian Wolf Dog in Great Britain and parts of Europe. Since then these types of dogs have been used and excelled in many other areas as well, including guide and assistance work for the handicapped, search-and-rescue, police and military work, drug detection and of course being a faithful companion.",
        "p3": "They are loyal, confident, courageous, could be of medium to large size, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. They’re amazingly versatile and probably one of the world's most recognized breeds.",
        "p4": "German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and true guardians with the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones.",
        "p5": "Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues, like ours. So remember to adopt and don’t shop if this is the breed for you.",

        "aboutMicrochips": "About Microchips",
        "intro": "What is a microchip, and how does it work?",
        "p1": "Why You Should Microchip Your Pet?",
        "p2": "Each year thousands of lost and abandoned animals are taken in by shelters and humane societies all over the world. Many of these animals never make it home because they can’t be identified. By microchipping your pet, you’ll dramatically improve your chance of being reunited if he or she goes missing or is stolen. It also helps provide proof of ownership once you show up at the rescue where they brought your pet to. Based on studies in the US the return-to-owner rate at shelters for microchipped cats was 20 times higher, and 2.5 times greater for microchipped dogs.",
        "p3": "How is the microchip detected?",
        "p4": "The specific electronic code embedded in the chip can be 'read' with a microchip scanner. It will display the identification number on the scanner's screen. Although the microchips are inserted in a particular area on the pets, they might migrate, or move out of position with time. For that reason, the microchip reader will be passed over the entire body of the pet in order to ensure that the chip is detected if present.",
        "p5": "Do I need to do anything once the microchip is implanted in my pet?",
        "p6": "Once your pet has been microchipped, you will need to register your pet and add your name and contact information. The relevant documents and contact information will be provided to you by your veterinarian. He/she will also be able to tell you if there are any fees involved with the registration of the microchip. It is very important to register your pet's microchip identification. Failure to do so will render the entire process useless, as the microchip number will not be associated with anyone.",
        "p7": "Is it painful to insert the chip into my pet?",
        "p8": "This is a procedure that is very fast, safe and relatively pain-free. As the needle used to insert the microchip is large, some people might choose to have this done at the time of spaying or neutering their pet, so that the animals won’t feel it at all as they are anesthetized for those procedures anyway. However, the microchip can be implanted at any time.",
        "p9": "Isn’t a collar with identification tag enough for my pet?",
        "p10": "Although it is useful to have a collar with identification tag for your pet, they can still fall off or break if your pet gets lost, or be removed if someone steals your animal. Also at the beginning when the identification tags are new, they are easy to read. However, with time they might become challenging to read as they get old and worn out.",
        "p11": "What if my pet already has a tattoo?",
        "p12": "Tattoos can be very difficult to read as they can become obscured by hair. Even when they are in the ears of the pet, they can become faded over time, and the numbers and letters can become unreadable. They could also be altered by someone, which is not the case with the microchips. Even if the tattoo is readable, there are no common databases for this information. So the information about the pet and its owner can be difficult to obtain.",
        "p13": "Can a microchip work like a GPS?",
        "p14": "Contrary to what many people believe, microchips cannot be used as tracking devices. They can be checked with a microchip scanner by a veterinarian or shelter organization and are a form of identification.",
        "p15": "Microchips are IDs that cannot be tampered with and cannot be misread",
        "p16": "Tags and collars can easily fall off or be removed if someone wishes to steal your precious pet. They could also be replaced by a thief easily. Microchips on the other hand are tamper-proof as they are inserted under the skin of your pet. The ID number stored on the microchip refers to a database entry and only authorized parties have access to this information, such as veterinary offices and animal shelters.  ",
        "p17": "Your personal information is safe",
        "p18": "As identity theft is becoming more of a problem in today’s society, rest assured that the information stored on the microchip and in the database is very safe. No data other than the unique reference number is stored on the chip itself. The details provided regarding this reference number will be accessible via the database managed and secured by the microchip provider.",

        "p1": "What does spay or neuter mean?",
        "p2": "“Spaying” and “neutering” are surgical procedures used to prevent animals from reproducing. They have many health and behavioral benefits to the animal beside preventing unwanted offspring.",
        "p3": "The Benefits of spaying and neutering your pet",
        "p4": "Studies show that spayed/neutered pets, on average, live longer.",
        "p5": "Spaying and neutering will decrease aggressive behavior which would make your dog calmer, less frustrated and less likely to bite, attack or get into dog fights.",
        "p6": "Spaying ends the heat cycle in females which would happen usually twice a year for dogs. Heat cycles result in many unwanted behavioral changes, including possible aggression.",
        "p7": "Spaying and neutering lowers the chance of reproductive health problems including the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer and pyometra (life-threatening infection of the uterus).",
        "p8": "Spaying reduces the risk of mammary cancer. Neutering eliminates the risk of testicular cancer and lowers the risk of prostate problems in male dogs.",
        "p9": "Spaying and neutering eliminates the drive to reproduce and also prevents accidental pregnancies. The likelihood of your male pet wandering away or escaping will be decreased.",
        "p10": "During Spaying and neutering other important procedures may also be performed at the time of the operation such as an identification tattoo, microchip implant, teeth cleaning or hernia repair.",
        "p11": "Spaying and neutering your pet help reduce overpopulation issues as it helps reduce the number of stray or unwanted animals in your community. Reducing the amount of stray animals helps prevent other pets and wildlife from being injured or killed.",
        "p12": "Are there some risks to spaying and neutering?",
        "p13": "Any surgical procedure carries some risks. However, the overall benefit outweighs the risk for most animals. Please talk to your veterinarian in case you have any questions or concerns.",
        "p14": "When should my dog be fixed?",
        "p15": "The usual recommendation is before six and a half months for dogs. Consult your veterinarian to determine the best time for your pet. Female dogs do not have to have a litter before being fixed.",
